Demo notebook to explore an OMICS dataset related to diabetes: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE9006 

Notebook goes through different data science processes: 
* problem description, 
* data collection and preprocessing, 
* exploratory data analysis, 
* feature engineering, 
* modeling, 
* analysis. 

Given a sparse and noisey dataset, several predictive models were generated with an accuracy of ~75%. 

Given the preliminary nature of this work, more effort will be needed to improve accuracy. 

Some possible areas for future work include: collecting more data, better featurization, and extended model tuning.
